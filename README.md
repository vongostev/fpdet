# fpdet
 Basic analytical functions for a few-photon light detection
 
 This module includes:
 - Direct and inverse photodetection matrices for binomial and subbinomial detection models (**d_matrix** and **invd_matrix**)
 - Function to calculate the photocount distribution from the photon-number one (**P2Q**) and vice versa (**Q2P**)
 - Some utility functions like fidelity, moments, convolution and entropy
